Console Error: Token is required

:: Issue: Page fails to refresh token after 15 mins, goes back to login page

Details:
SameSite is not set or is invalid, defaults to SameSite=Lax, prevents the cookie
from being set in in a cross-site context.

Resolve by updating the attributes of the cookie;

SameSite=None
AND 
Secure

** 10/13/2020:
** Implemented in UserController.setTokenCookie(string token)
        {

            var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions
            {
                HttpOnly = true,
                Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7),
                SameSite = SameSiteMode.None,
                Secure = true
            };
            Response.Cookies.Append("refreshToken", token, cookieOptions);
        }


        //~~~~~~ Has this been resolved? I don't think so (Oct 26 2020)??




        How would you write this js/jsx script is cs??

        // import React from 'react'

                const something = () => {

                        const _else = 2
                        const _something_else = 11

                        let _what = _else * _something_else

                        console.log(_what)
                        console.log("?")
                }

                export default something
